DDoS Attacks: Types and Traditional Mitigation Methods

A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack occurs when attackers use infected computers known as botnets to send excessive traffic to servers and networks which blocks their legitimate users from accessing them. The current wave of attacks uses hundreds of thousands of devices including IoT devices which work together to create massive disruptions that result in substantial financial losses. [1]

The main reasons behind DDoS attacks include attempts to obtain money through extortion as well as seeking revenge and hacktivism and political activism and damaging someone's reputation. [1]
The attacks result in question lead to service interruptions and harm reputation and result in monetary losses.

Notable DDoS Attack Categories

1. Volume-Based Attacks
The attackers use their massive data volume to overwhelm bandwidth at Gbps/Tbps levels.
The attackers use UDP Flood and ICMP Flood (ping) and SYN Flood and Spoofed-Packet Floods and packet fragments to execute their attacks.
The Mirai botnet used IoT devices to generate enormous network traffic during its operation.

2. Protocol-Based Attacks
The attackers use network protocol process weaknesses to achieve their objectives.
The attackers use SYN Flood (partial TCP handshakes) and Ping of Death and Smurf attack and Land attack (packets with identical source/destination IPs) and ARP Spoofing precursors to execute their attacks.
The attacks lead to server resource exhaustion through memory and CPU usage while revealing system weaknesses.

3. Application-Layer Attacks
The attackers focus on discovering weaknesses that exist within software applications at their fundamental level.
The attackers use HTTP flooding and Slowloris to maintain numerous HTTP connections and send malformed requests and exploit hash collisions and regular expression attacks.
The attacks cause web servers and applications to reach maximum capacity while blocking authorized users from accessing the system.

DDoS Mitigation Techniques

1. Filtering and Firewalls

- Network firewalls and Web Application Firewalls (WAF) refuse traffic based on rules (IP deny lists, protocol restrictions) and signatures.
- Limitation: They can be overwhelmed by bulk floods and may produce false positives, i.e., situations in which good traffic is blocked.

2. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)

- IDS: Inspects traffic for known signatures or abnormal behaviorâ€”it can be host-based or network-based.
- IPS: Eliminates the suspicious malicious traffic automatically and in real time.
- Limitation: They suffer from high false-positive rates, have poor detection of new/low-rate attacks, and may require periodic manual tuning.

3. Rate Limiting

- Restricts the amount of traffic to IP/user to certain limits.
- Limitation: The attackers can use multiple sources (botnets) to get around rate limits. Legitimate bursts may be blocked.

4. Resource Allocation & Redundancy

- Load balancers and content delivery networks (CDNs) divert traffic to different servers/locations to reduce the impact of traffic on a single server.
- Geo-distributed setups are redundant.
- Limitation: Attacks can target CDNs or fill up all the entry points; it is costly to scale globally.

5. Blacklists/Whitelists

- Employ deny/allow lists that are updated regularly for IPs that are confirmed to be malicious or legitimate.
- Limitation: IP spoofing and the rise of botnet can circumvent static lists.

6. Honeypots

- Install dummy systems to attract, trap, and study attacks to enhance the security system.
- Limitation: Cannot be used in real-time; only for monitoring.

7. Manual/Organized Response Plans

- Training of a proactive attitude and having pre-established plans of action in case of incidents.
- Continuous checking and software updates to close security holes.
- Limitation: The intervention of a human might be too late for a real-time defense.

8. Machine Learning and Behavior-Based Detection

- Machine Learning classifiers trained with regular and anomalous traffic patterns to detect subtle attacks, particularly zero-day attacks.
- Limitation: It may need a large number of high-quality data samples and continuous retraining.
- Quick note: Current research implementing ensemble ML, deep learning, and even blockchain integration for the addressed topics is at the advanced level.
