Introduction

Along with the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud-based applications, a DDoS attack ranks as one of the most dreadful risks to electronic systems of a modern type. Nowadays, the usual central mitigation method is gradually being considered as not enough in cases of fast-evolving and increasing in number botnet-powered attacks. In this regard, blockchain technology, being a decentralized, integrity and audit-friendly system, is one of the best examples that community-based, tamper-resistant DDoS defense together with IoT and SDN technologies can be looked at as a proper infrastructure for a single effect.

DDoS Attack Types & Traditional Mitigation

Attack Types

Volume-based: These are the types of attacks such as UDP Flood, ICMP Flood, SYN Flood, DNS amplification, created to exhaust the bandwidth of the target.
Protocol-based: These types of attacks include SYN Flood, Smurf, and ARP Spoofing, which exploit the vulnerabilities in the network/transport protocol.
Application-layer: These types of attack include HTTP Flood, CGI/Hash collision, Slowloris, which concentrate their efforts on web/apps at Layer 7.

Traditional Mitigation Approaches:

Firewalls & IDS/IPS: Function on signatures/behaviors and are weak against huge volumes of attacks.
Rate Limiting & Blacklists: Are good tools at a small scale, but the botnets can easily get around them.
CDN/Geo-load balancing: Does the job for a limited time by taking the load off the server that is under attack, but it's costly and has only slight effectiveness towards complex attacks.
Manual/human response: Is not able to match the speed of high-volume attacks happening in real-time.

Limitations: Each of them may be attacked through single points of failure, spoofed traffic, or resource exhaustion.

Key Table: DDoS Types vs Defenses

| Attack Type         | Legacy Method       | Limitation                    |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Volume-based        | CDN, Firewall       | Bandwidth overload            |
| Protocol-based      | Firewall, IPS       | Protocol spoofing/complexity  |
| App-layer           | WAF, Signature IDS  | Evasion via legitimate traffic|

3. Role & Mechanism of Blockchain in DDoS Mitigation

- Decentralization: The point of failure of the single sever is removed - security logic runs on multiple, distributed nodes.
- Immutability: Forensic logging - the whole attack trail cannot be changed or deleted.
- Collaborative Defense: Smart contracts mutually agree on and share blacklists, access rules, and attack data with all network participants thus enabling them to act quickly.
- Automation: On-the-fly, automatically executed mitigation via smart contracts.

Architectural Categories:

- Distributed Architecture: Several blockchain nodes keeping track of and coordinating the response to an attack (e.g., CREDIT, BloSS).
- Access Management: Smart contracts for decentralized whitelist/blacklist enforcement.
- Traffic Control: SDN working together with the blockchain to redirect, throttle, and quarantine the suspicious flows.
- Ethereum-based Solutions: Smart contracts log attacker IPs, automate blocking.

Advanced Integration

- ML/Deep Learning: Random Forest, CNN, LSTM detecting anomalies; sharing the learned results via blockchain.
- Federated Learning: Distributed privacy-preserving DDoS detection (IIoT, edge).
- Edge Computing: Places detection/prevention at the network perimeter, records events in blockchain.
- Hybrid SDN+Blockchain+AI: For example, Mirai defense, IoT botnet containment.

5. Key Metrics for Evaluation

- Detection performance (ROC, F1, precision, recall)
- Time of mitigation (block time, traffic blocking rates)
- Ability to scale (nodes, bandwidth, device types)
- Energy/resource consumption (CPU, memory, on IoT/edge devices)
- False positive/negative rates
- Resilience/recovery (auto-repair, forensic traceability)
- Deployment cost/complexity
- Compliance/regulatory compatibility (NIST, ISO, MiCA)

6. Strengths, Weaknesses, and Research Gaps

Strengths

- The decentralizing of the attack resistance focus by the shift of the attack thus single points of failure are eliminated.
- Blockchain smart contracts enable automated and effortless real-time communication and shared intelligence.
- The permanence and the inviolability of the log records (very important for support and compliance).
- Supporting the open and distributed learning model for a highly complex, fully automatic AI defense system.

Weaknesses

- There are as little as few solutions that are robust in the integration between detection and mitigation (i.e., prevention but not dynamic defense).
- Not a single one of them has really been scaled up to test a big distributed network comprising thousands of IoT nodes, while most have only been tested at the small scale.
- This shift results in the introduction of dependence on SDN for bottlenecks in the controller.
- In addition to security risks, if there is an incorrect coding or vetting, smart contracts may become vulnerable to attackers.
- The outcome of the tradeoff is between security and performance as blockchain networks might result in increased latency.
- These kinds of attacks are hard to defend against as they impersonate legitimate traffic and do not provide for flow-based rules.

7. Research Directions

- Collaborative, layered DDoS response with Hybrid AI-Blockchain-SDN defense architectures.
- Federated deep learning for privacy-preserving real-time DDoS detection (IIoT, edge networks).
- To incentivize participants sharing information for attack defense, Blockchain-enabled incentive systems.
