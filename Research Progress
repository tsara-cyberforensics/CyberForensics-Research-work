1. Introduction
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks represent one of the most critical threats to contemporary digital systems—especially as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud applications proliferate. Traditional centralized mitigation is increasingly proving insufficient against rapidly evolving, botnet-powered attacks. Blockchain technology, due to its decentralization, integrity, and auditability, has emerged as a promising infrastructure for collaborative, tamper-resistant DDoS defense, especially when synergized with IoT and software-defined networking (SDN).

2. DDoS Attack Types & Traditional Mitigation

Attack Types
- Volume-based: UDP Flood, ICMP Flood, SYN Flood, DNS amplification—aim to overwhelm bandwidth.
- Protocol-based: SYN Flood, Smurf, ARP Spoofing—exploit network/transport protocol vulnerabilities.
- Application-layer: HTTP Flood, CGI/Hash collision, Slowloris—target web/apps at Layer 7.

Traditional Mitigation Approaches
- Firewalls & IDS/IPS: Signature/behavior-based, but vulnerable to volume.
- Rate Limiting & Blacklists: Useful in small scales, but botnets easily bypass.
- CDN/Geo-load balancing: Deflects traffic, but expensive with limited effectiveness against sophisticated attacks.
- Manual/human response: Too slow for real-time high-volume attacks.
- Limitations: All are vulnerable to single points of failure, spoofed traffic, or resource exhaustion.

Key Table: DDoS Types vs Defenses

| Attack Type         | Legacy Method       | Limitation                   |
|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Volume-based        | CDN, Firewall       | Bandwidth overload            |
| Protocol-based      | Firewall, IPS       | Protocol spoofing/complexity  |
| App-layer           | WAF, Signature IDS  | Evasion via legitimate traffic|

3. Role & Mechanism of Blockchain in DDoS Mitigation

- Decentralization: Removes single point of failure—security logic runs on multiple, distributed nodes.
- Immutability: Forensic logging—attack trails cannot be tampered with or deleted.
- Collaborative Defense: Smart contracts share and enforce blacklists, access rules, and attack data across all network participants instantly.
- Automation: Real-time, auto-enforced mitigation using smart contracts.

Architectural Categories:
- Distributed Architecture: Multiple blockchain nodes track and coordinate attack response (e.g., CREDIT, BloSS).
- Access Management: Smart contracts for decentralized whitelist/blacklist enforcement.
- Traffic Control: SDN integrates with blockchain to redirect, throttle, and quarantine suspicious flows.
- Ethereum-based Solutions: Smart contracts log attacker IPs, automate blocking.

Advanced Integration
- ML/Deep Learning: Random Forest, CNN, LSTM detect anomalies; share learned results via blockchain.
- Federated Learning: Distributed privacy-preserving DDoS detection (IIoT, edge).
- Edge Computing: Deploys detection/prevention at the network perimeter, logs events in blockchain.
- Hybrid SDN+Blockchain+AI: E.g., Mirai defense, IoT botnet containment.
